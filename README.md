# Dynamic Charts Tutorial by Daniel Fitzgerald

Dynamic charts using Angular.js, WebSockets and Google Charts. In this sample I demonstrate
how to build beautiful dynamic charts that update as data comes in from a WebSocket. This can
be used to visualize real time data such as stocks or Internet of Things sensor data.

> WebSockets is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication
> session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server
> and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
